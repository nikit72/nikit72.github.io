                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">Over 30 million people in the US have diabetes, and while it most
                    often develops in adults, the decisions you make and habits you form in the early stages of your
                    life can lead to its prevention. Children are not always equipped with the knowledge to make healthy
                    decisions though, let alone the effects of developing diabetes. As members of Global Ties, a
                    humanitarian program focused on solving socially urgent problems, our goal was to better educate
                    children about type 2 diabetes.

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">While the previous team had created a working prototype, we found
                    it lacked gameplay supported by effective learning models. Researching behavioral change theories in
                    health education and learning, we discovered the 5E Model of instruction, the Social
                    Cognitive Theory, and the 5 Step Decision Process, used in CDE’s Health Education Framework, would be
                    useful tools in formatting the minigame structures in Diabeatit.</p>

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">While interviewing education professionals, the director of the
                    Partners at Learning (PAL) Program stressed the developmental differences between ages 8-13. 2nd
                    graders are just beginning to learn how to solve simple problems whereas 8th graders are already
                    practicing critical thinking. Looking into the California Department of Education’s & Health
                    Education Content Standards, we decided it would be best to narrow our scope to 4th and 5th graders
                    (ages 9-11). During these grades, kids are learning about their own well being and developing more
                    complex decision making skills, both integral aspects of our game.</p>

                <h3>Evaluating Current Interface</h3>
                <p>Another aspect that needed to be further developed was the user interface of the game itself. While
                    we wanted to teach kids about diabetes, we also had to make sure that kids could navigate the game
                    easily. This meant analyzing the different parts of the game to see what was lacking and what was
                    working to better improve the play experience. For this, I did secondary research on game design for
                    children and analyzed the previous team’s user testing feedback.</p>

                <h3>Story & Structure</h3>
                <p>Games allow kids to naturally learn through play. Before we focused on lesson plans, we first had to
                    ideate ways the child could gain intrinsic motivation to play the game. Recreating the storyline
                    would allow us to take the game setting from a child’s everyday lifestyle to a fantastical one,
                    allowing the child to learn from a new perspective and explore an unknown world.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>With the storyline in mind, I began creating an information architecture that would cover the stages
                    in developing decision making skills. We wanted to allow the child to process through the game
                    smoothly, but allow them to have the freedom to explore different topics they wanted to learn more
                    about.</p>

                <h3>Ideating an Effective Minigame</h3>
                <p>In order to test out our research backed concepts, we wanted to have at least one minigame structured
                    based on the learning theories we researched. Due to time restraints, we decided to restructure the
                    format of Kitchen Showdown, a current minigame in Diabeatit, rather than create our own game.</p>

                <h3>User Testing & Feedback</h3>
                <p>Testing the game with kids was one of my favorite parts of this project. With a prototype created on
                    Figma, we connected with teachers in the greater San Diego area and were able
                    to test the game with a class of fourth grade students. Because we wanted to test retention of new
                    knowledge,
                    we created a quiz about diabetes for before and after the game. Using a tablet, we conducted
                    contextual inquiry as the child played the game to understand their thoughts and actions in response
                    to the user interface.</p>

                <p>
                    It was a really good experience hearing from kids themselves and their suggestions on how to make
                    the game better! We found that the kids wanted what we would consider a bigger challenge by
                    requesting more detailed information about food sugar levels and more options when applying this
                    information. Their own curiousity carried their exploration into the topic further. They also
                    provided useful feedback on the userface that we were able to apply in the next iteration of the
                    game. With this, our team then passed on our work for the future development team to implement.
