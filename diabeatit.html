                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">Over 30 million people in the US have diabetes, and while it most
                    often develops in adults, the decisions you make and habits you form in the early stages of your
                    life can lead to prevention. Children are not always equipped with the knowledge to make healthy
                    decisions though, especially children in poverty who might not have access to these choices. As
                    members of Global Ties, a humanitarian program focused on solving socially urgent problems, our goal
                    is to introduce this information in a way that is comprehensible, accessible, and fun to children.

                    effective learning models. After talking to educational professionals who work with children, I
                    looked into the California Department of Education’s Health Education Content Standards to see how
                    our material would align with each grade’s current curriculum. </p>

                    graders would allow us to apply teaching methods that would prove effective in developing this
                    group’s problem solving and decision making skills for their well being. We discovered the five step
                    decision process, used in CDE’s Health Education Framework, would be a useful tool in formatting how
                    kids can learn through our minigames.</p>

                <p>Another aspect of the game that needed to be developed was the user interface of the game itself.
                    While we wanted to teach kids about diabetes, we also had to make sure that kids would want to
                    play
                    and could navigate the game to begin with. This meant analyzing the different parts of the game
                    to
                    see what was lacking and what was working to better improve the play experience. </p>

                <h3>A New Game Narrative</h3>
                <p>In order for kids to stay engaged while learning through the game, we wanted to create a new
                    narrative for the game. Rather than having an introduction where a kid with diabetes comes home from
                    school and then has access to multiple minigames, I explored a different approach that followed a
                    make-believe story but allowed kids to still make connections to real life applications.</p>

                    Gluccy in their journey through a human body that has type 2 diabetes. This would allow us to create
                    minigames that follow a storyline and add imaginative and interactive details to the game that would
                    not be available if grounded in reality.</p>

                <p>In order to test out our concepts based on our research, we wanted to have at least one game
                    structured based on the Health Education Frameworks. Due to time restraints, we decided to
                    restructure a current minigame in Diabeatit called Kitchen Showdown. Its current tutorial is filled
                    with a lot of text, making it very easy to skip by children. While the game itself can be very
                    informative when playing, it is also very possible for the player to gloss over it for the functions
                    of the gameplay itself. To begin, we first started to ideate different lesson plan models that the
                    game could follow.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>With a prototype created and ready for testing, we connected with teachers in the greater San Diego
                    area and were lucky enough to be able to test the game with fourth grade students. Because we wanted
                    to test retention of new knowledge, we created a quiz about diabetes for before and after the game.
                    We then allowed them to play through it and voice their thoughts and opinions. It was a really good
                    experience hearing from kids themselves and their suggestions on how to make the game better! We
                    gained a lot of insights and found that the children’s knowledge of diabetes did increase by the end
                    of the game. With that, we analyzed the data and will be passing on our work to the next team. You
