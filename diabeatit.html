                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">Over 30 million people in the US have diabetes, and while it most
                    often develops in adults, the decisions you make and habits you form in the early stages of your
                    life can lead to its prevention. Children are not always equipped with the knowledge to make healthy
                    decisions though, let alone the effects of developing diabetes. As members of Global Ties, a
                    humanitarian program focused on solving socially urgent problems, our goal is to introduce this
                    information in a way that is comprehensible, accessible, and fun to children.

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">While the previous team had created a working prototype, we found
                    it lacked gameplay supported by effective learning models. Researching behavioral change theories in
                    health education and learning theories, we discovered the 5E Model of instruction, the Social
                    Cognitive Theory and the 5 Step Decision Process, used in CDE’s Health Education Framework, would be
                    useful tools in formatting the minigame structures in Diabeatit.</p>

                    Partners at Learning (PAL) Program stressed the developmental differences between ages 8-13. 2nd
                    graders are just beginning to learn how to solve simple problems whereas 8th graders are already
                    practicing critical thinking. Looking into the California Department of Education’s & Health
                    Education Content Standards, we decided it would be best to narrow our scope to 4th and 5th graders
                    (ages 9-11). During these grades, kids are learning about their own well being and developing more
                    complex decision making skills, both integral aspects of our game.</p>

                <h3>Evaluating Current Interface</h3>
                <p>Another aspect that needed to be further developed was the user interface of the game itself. While
                    we wanted to teach kids about diabetes, we also had to make sure that kids could navigate the game
                    easily. This meant analyzing the different parts of the game to see what was lacking and what was
                    working to better improve the play experience. For this, I did secondary research on game design for
                    children and analyzed the previous team’s user testing feedback.</p>

                <h3>Restructuring the Storyline</h3>
                <p>In order for kids to stay engaged while learning, a new storyline was needed. Rather than presenting
                    an array of mini-games based on everyday life, I explored a different approach. Using character
                    customization to project themselves into the game, kids would be able to play a fictional storyline
                    with connections to real life applications. </p>

                <p>By personifying aspects of diabetes, such as Gluccy the Glucose, the player would be able to assist
                    Gluccy in their journey through a human body that has type 2 diabetes. This would allow us to create
                    minigames with an overarching theme and add imaginative and interactive elements that would not be
                    available if based on everyday life.</p>

                <h3>Ideating an Effective Minigame</h3>
                <p>In order to test out our research backed concepts, we wanted to have at least one minigame structured
                    based on the learning theories we researched. Due to time restraints, we decided to restructure the
                    format of Kitchen Showdown, a current minigame in Diabeatit, rather than create our own game.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Testing the game with kids was one of my favorite parts of this project. With a prototype created and
                    ready for feedback, we connected with teachers in the greater San Diego area and were lucky enough
                    to test the game with fourth grade students. Because we wanted to test retention of new knowledge,
                    we created a quiz about diabetes for before and after the game. Using a tablet, we conducted
                    contextual inquiry as the child played the game.</p>
                <p>
                    It was a really good
                    experience hearing from kids themselves and their suggestions on how to make the game better! We
                    gained a lot of insights and found that the children’s knowledge of diabetes did increase by the end
                    of the game. With that, we analyzed the data and will be passing on our work to the next team. You
