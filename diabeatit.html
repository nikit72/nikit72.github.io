                    often develops in adults, the decisions you make and the habits you form in the early stages of your
                    life can lead to the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Anupam and Vidya are graduate students in the
                    medical sciences at UCSD who are passionate about spreading health awareness to the public. As a
                    member of Global Ties, a program that partners with nonprofits and NGOs to co-create solutions to
                    socially urgent problems, our team was tasked with creating an engaging and comprehensive game for
                    kids to learn about type 2 diabetes prevention. After completion of the game, it will be hosted in
                    hospital waiting rooms for kids to play. With 2 years contributed to this project by previous
                    members already, our team is taking the work and research that many conducted and continuing to
                    iterate.</p>

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">While the previous team had passed on a setup for the game, the
                    current version lacked the backing of effective learning models intertwined with the gameplay and
                    the age range 8-13 for the game was too broad to account for all the developmental differences.
                    After talking to professionals who work with children, we looked into the Health Education Content
                    Standards and current curriculum for each grade to see how our material would align with what
                    students were already learning. This allowed us to narrow our scope to fourth and fifth graders,
                    who would be learning material that aligned with what Diabeatit would teach.</p>

                    in order to apply teaching methods that would prove effective in developing their problem solving
                    and decision making for their well being. We discovered the five step decision process would be a
                    useful tool in formatting how kids can learn through our minigames.</p>

                <h4>Game Design</h4>
                <p>Another aspect of the game that needed to be developed was the design of the game itself. While we
                    wanted to teach kids about diabetes prevention and management, we had to make sure that kids would
                    want to play the game in the first place. This meant analyzing the different parts of the game to
                    see what was lacking and what was working to better improve the play experience. </p>

                <h4>Creating a Narrative</h4>
                <p>In order for kids to stay engaged in the game in a healthy manner, we revamped how the structure of
                    the game flowed. Rather than the game following the life of a kid with diabetes come home from
                    school, I explored a different narrative that was more whimsical but allowed kids to still make
                    connections to real life application. </p>

                <h4>Minigame Structure & Prototype</h4>
                <p>The current tutorial for the minigame tutorial is filled with a lot of information about diabetes,
                    and that’s what makes it easily skippable by children. We broke down the information into easy to
                    understand dialogue and formed a story with facts about diabetes based on effective lesson plan
                    structures. When creating a prototype, we redesigned the interface to better fit the interactions
                    needed for kids to be drawn to the correct information on the screen. Feel free to explore our <u><a

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>With a prototype created and ready for testing, we connected with teachers in the greater San Diego
                    area and were lucky enough to be able to test the game with fourth grade students. Because we wanted
                    to test retention of new knowledge, we created a quiz about diabetes for before and after the game.
                    We then allowed them to play through it and voice their thoughts and opinions. It was a really good
                    experience hearing from kids themselves and their suggestions on how to make the game better! We
                    gained a lot of insights and found that the children’s knowledge of diabetes did increase by the end
                    of the game. With that, we analyzed the data and will be passing on our work to the next team. You
                    can play through the <u><a
