                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>For an interactive design course, my team was tasked with designing an app for people of the age
                    range 60-80. We decided to focus on people who have retired. While retirement might sound fun,
                    retired members of society often have difficulty adjusting to the change in lifestyle and can have
                    negative effects. With an increase in free time and lack of socializing, isolation and loss of
                    motivation become more apparent. With this in mind, my team wanted to break this cycle.

                <h4>Storyboards</h4>
                <p>In order to understand the behaviors and needs of our users, we began to research and create personas
                    and storyboards that would delve into the nuances of our user’s everyday life. Through our
                    storyboards, we discovered issues they might face when using technology, why they might lose
                    motivation in their goals, and what interactions might impact their lives and what they do. This was
                    a very eye-opening process for me, especially as a college student trying to better empathize with
                    an older generation. Much of daily technology is not designed for our users and we wanted to ensure
                    they didn’t feel that way when they use ours.

                <h4>Paper Prototypes</h4>
                <p>Before prototyping, we decided we would focus on skill sharing, companionship, and traveling as our
                    main avenues to encourage our users to try new things. With these concepts, we came up with several
                    diverse paper prototypes. With our various visions, we were able to organize which ideas and designs
                    would best fit our goal for this project. Below is an example of a prototype I ideated.

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>After discussing the pros and cons of our prototypes, we also took a step back to think about what
                    needs we were really trying to solve with our app. We wanted to make sure we were thinking of our
                    users first and foremost. While our experiences led us to add many functions to our prototype, it
                    was better for our user if we limited what functions were available. This allowed us to rethink if
                    our solution was really needed and if we were thinking in the perspective of our users. This With a
                    fresh new perspective, we decided to narrow our idea to a bucket list app and create a cohesive
                    digital prototype.

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>User testing was extremely important for us to see how useful the functions we included were and what
                    possible issues our users might run into. Due to time constraints, we were not able to test on many
                    retirees but found people who volunteered with the elderly. This also provided us an opportunity to
                    receive differing ideas on how to improve the usability and functionality of our app. We decided on
                    a few major changes on our main pages to ensure that going back and forth between pages was
                    intuitive while removing a few functions that we found to be unnecessary.

                <p>Above are some examples of the changes we made. Accessibility was a main priority for us and
                    helped shape a lot of the changes we made. We made our navbar consistent on all screens to
                    avoid confusing the user when switching screens. We also avoided using only icons by including
                    text for users who might not know what those icons mean. In order to ensure our users could
                    read the text on small screens, we increased the default text size and choose an easy to read
                    font. Another change was using bold colors for important functions to help guide our users to
                    those information and functions.

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>With a lot of tweaks, revisions, and feedback, we were able to finalize a functioning prototype
                    geared for people in their retirement. Here are some of the main screens of our Ripple app!

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>This was a really fun project and really shaped how I view accessibility. Designing for a demographic
                    that is often forgotten about when it comes to technology showed me how narrow my view was
                    beforehand. There are so many intricacies in the decisions a person must make before they finalize
                    their product. Every decision can have a big effect on your user, and it is up to you to make a
                    cognizant choice. In order to do so, you must be aware of what those affecting factors are, and
                    through this project, I found that you must make a conscious effort to find what those factors are
                    as a designer. Design is really powerful in that way and Ripple was a great experience in learning
                    how to make those choices for our users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only that, this project was filled with teamwork and working with my teammates was a privilege I
                    am thankful I had. Although we didn’t agree on everything, making decisions based on assigned tasks,
                    feedback, and what was best for our users was a useful lesson. We also explored our creative
                    liberties with this project and being surrounded by passionate people really pushed this project to
                    be the great experience that it was. We even made a fun video to go along with our app! Overall, I
                    appreciate the ripple this project and my team made in my life.
