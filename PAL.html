                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>The PAL Program at UCSD is a learning service program that provides undergraduates the opportunity to
                    work with P-12 students in underrepresented communities. With many hours of volunteering and
                    mentorship, they help P-12 students reach their academic potential and inspire them to pursue
                    lifelong education. One of the more current programs they have just launched is aiding first and
                    second graders reach their average reading levels through tutoring services provided by UCSD
                    undergraduates. With it being their first run, they have the skills but lack the foundation to
                    sustain the program for future tutors. As a member of Global Ties, a program that partners with
                    nonprofits and NGOs to co-create solutions to socially urgent problems, my team was tasked with
                    creating a website for the PAL tutors.

                <h4>Interviews</h4>
                <p>To get a deeper understanding of our problem, one of the first steps we took was interviewing and
                    observing our stakeholders. This allowed us to grasp the needs of our possible users and ensure that
                    we had everyone’s perspective, especially when there were conflicting ideas. From the director of
                    the program to observations of the schools, we gained a diverse and insightful understanding of how
                    the program functioned. With this information, we then conducted a stakeholder analysis to see who
                    would play the most crucial roles and how to interact with each stakeholder. This was really
                    important because while some had higher power in the project, they weren’t the main users of our
                    product.

                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>Once we had a better idea of how the PAL Program functioned and their initiatives, we then created an
                    impact gap canvas with secondary research. This canvas highlights three things: the formation of the
                    problem, the solution landscape, and why there is a gap between the problem and solution.

                <p>With this in mind, we then began to ideate on possible ways to fill that gap and fulfill our client’s
                    wish. We wanted to think big at first, explore all possible solutions, before we started to apply
                    the constraints given to us. While our objective was to create a website, by thinking outside the
                    box, we could see the effects our product would have on others. This was really helpful in opening
                    our eyes to concepts that we wouldn’t have thought of for our product if we had solely focused on a
                    website as a solution.

                <h4>Decision Matrix</h4>
                <p>While ideating different ways we could tackle the needs of our users, we eventually focused on three
                    possible solutions: a hard coded site, a learning management system, or a site builder. For us, the
                    backend development was essential to what solution we would provide as we wanted our product to be
                    sustainable in the future. While tutors were the main users of the information on our product, the
                    PAL Program leaders would be the ones to produce the material on the site. A hardcoded site would
                    have more functionality and freedom in how it looked but at the cost of the usability. The PAL
                    Program leaders did not know how to code and updating the site would be impossible in the future.
                    With our interviews in mind, we created a decision matrix to ensure we would b

                <p>We also updated our stakeholders on the solutions we were looking into to ensure they were on
                    board. We found that the Google Classroom, a learning management system, would be able to
                    provide the client with what they needed best.

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>Once we solidified our prototype as the Google Classroom, we observed how our potential users, mainly
                    the tutors and PAL Program leaders, would interact with the website. This was a great opportunity to
                    see the product from the perspective of our users. While interviews gave us information on what the
                    tutors knew they needed, observations gave us information on what they might not notice about
                    themselves as they tutor. With this, we then created a feedback capture grid to see what could be
                    improved and implemented into our final prototype.

                <p>While creating a hub of information was important, we found that breaking down the information to be
                    more beginner friendly became was critical as well. This started a conversation with our client on
                    permissions of the material posted on the site. Once they allowed us to do so, we began to reformat
                    instructions and files so that new tutors would not be intimidated by all the information.

                    our clients. After some tweaks, we delivered a product that would be both sustainable and accessible
                    for the tutoring program now and into the future as they grow!

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>The was a really valuable project that taught me the nuances that come with working with a client and
                    doing human centered design. There were a lot of moments where we were given multiple perspectives
                    that conflicted and this created an opportunity for us to take a step back and reevaluate how we
                    approached our solution. Communication was really key to having everyone on the same page and
                    knowing that our stakeholders were aware of what we were doing during every step of the way. A big
                    challenge we had was that our client had a solution in mind and as we conducted interviews with our
                    users, we found that the solution might not have been the answer. This gave us a chance to pitch our
                    ideas and work with our client to find a better solution. Another lesson I received from this
                    project is that sometimes the solution is simple. We had not imagined that using Google Classroom
                    was a possibility, but due to usability and how accessible it was, it became the best option. While
                    it isn’t a complex site or app we built from scratch, it is what the PAL Program needs and
                    fulfilling that need is the most important part of this project.
