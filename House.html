                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">With the fourth highest homeless population in the US, San Diego’s resources runs thin when it comes to serving people suffering from housing insecurity. As people passionate about serving the community, my design team wanted to work with current organizations that already serve the homeless population. While housing insecurity is a big problem to tackle, we believe that helping people that already have a foundation in this issue would allow us to alleviate some of their hardships while contributing to our local homeless community in a meaningful way.

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3>Needfinding</h3>
                <p>Rather than pinpoint a problem ourselves, we decided to explore the areas of interest and see what
                    key insights we would discover. Setting out for field days, we visited multiple homeless shelters
                    and day centers to have a conversation with the people who frequent them, names left out for
                    confidentiality. One of our key findings was that due to many regulations and underfunding,
                    inefficiencies in these spaces arise and bigger problems constrain the staff from being able to fix
                    them.
                </p>

                <p>Along with the visits and information from various housing insecurity organizations in San Diego, we
                    were lucky to find an organization that was very willing to work with us. The RWC is a day center
                    specifically for women who are homeless, and working with them was a great opportunity for us to
                    focus on one organization and ensure we would be able to feasibly contribute to a community. Their
                    staff and volunteers, though small in number, are passionate people who put their time and effort in
                    helping the women suffering from housing insecurity.</p>

                <h3>Interviews & Observations</h3>
                <p>With our area of interest narrowed to RWC, we then began conducting interviews with the people who
                    frequent the center and observations of how the space is run. We narrowed our stakeholders to three
                    specific categories: patrons, staff members, and the umbrella organization that the RWC was under.
                </p>

                    <div class="col-sm-1">

                            src="images/hssh.png" />

                    <div class="col-sm-1">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>A big constraint we had while interviewing was the safety of the women who frequented the center, the
                    time that the staff had available to talk to us, and what the umbrella organization would allow us
                    to design. We wanted to be mindful as outsiders in a safe space for these patrons and not take too
                    much of the RWC’s time. This meant multiple visits in small pairings and observations when the staff
                    members could conduct their tasks without staying with us. We also had to be aware that big changes
                    in the RWC would prove difficult because of regulations and restrictions created by their umbrella
                    organization. Below are photos of us doing observations of their mail distribution while ensuring
                    people's privacy. We would later find that these observations were key to our designs.</p>

                <h3>Problem Spaces</h3>
                <p>While we had some constraints, our stakeholders’ willingness to help gave us a multitude of insights.
                    RWC provides a wide array of services and programs for its homeless patrons, but we found that many
                    of these avenues of support have obstacles that undermine their effectiveness. While we worked to
                    further scope down on issues within RWC, our affinity diagram revealed several small problems that
                    occur frequently within the space. As we worked and replotted, we found that many of these smaller
                    issues could branch back to a result of a handful of design issues. Among these few design issues,
                    our team identified three key design problems that we want to delve into: mail services, patron
                    involvement, and patron belongings. </p>

                <h3>Personas & Storyboards</h3>
                <p>
                    With possible problem spaces to explore, we began creating personas and storyboards that would
                    reflect the emotions and actions that our stakeholders experienced in these spaces. This was crucial
                    in creating a narrative that would help us as designers delve deeper into the issue and better
                    understand the people involved in these scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>One of the key insights I received from this was understanding the difference between the patron’s
                    and staff’s perspective. It is important to me as a designer to ensure that all the people who would
                    use the design would be accounted for as one solution for one group won’t always benefit the other
                    groups involved. The storyboards reminded me to keep that in mind when continuing in this project.

                <h3>Ideation & Prototyping</h3>
                <p>With mail services, patron involvement, and managing patron belongings being our main categories, we
                    began brainstorming possible solutions no matter how big. While we wanted to focus on creating
                    something feasible for the RWC, designing outside of the box at first would allow us to have
                    everything on the table, share amongst ourselves, and see what concepts could become feasible with
                    some tweaks and influence from each other and our insights.
                </p>
                <p>Eventually we decided to focus on mail distribution as our main problem space due to its high
                    likelihood of implementation. With that, we began ideating more concrete designs and prototyping how
                    they would look like. We eventually focused in on redesigning the entire mail distribution system.

                <h3>Testing & Feedback</h3>
                <p>With a concrete prototype ready for use, we had to get a bit creative with our user testing. Due to
                    the RWC’s busy hours and tight schedule, we decided to test our prototype via live action roleplay
                    and verbal feedback from the staff members during a visit to the RWC.
                </p>
                <p>While we weren’t able to test it directly with our stakeholders, we were still able to discover many
                    issues and receive useful feedback to better our prototype. This helped us improve our prototype and
                    account from problems that we did not find in our initial prototype.
