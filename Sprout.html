                <p>Ever since I was a child, the arts have always been an area that has inspired me. From drawing to
                    dancing, there are so many opportunities to create, express, and explore, but with it comes many
                    roadblocks and struggles when you are uninspired. With so many branches and possibilities, my team
                    of three wanted to dive into how we could enhance the experience of creating. As people who were
                    invested in different forms of art, we decided to focus our efforts on the needs of
                    artists and finding our problem there.</p>

                <h4>Finding those Needs</h4>
                <p>Art is such a diverse topic! And we wanted to make sure to get those diverse experiences. We began
                    our exploration by observing and interviewing people involved in different art forms in order to
                    view art in their eyes. We went to the source, such as by going out to dance practices or finding
                    people drawing, observing them perform their art related tasks, and asking for interviews. Having
                    both observations and interviews allowed us to see what problems artists were aware of and what
                    problems they might not notice while they create.</p>

                <p>The different art forms we focused on was dance, drawing, and comedy. As the activities we targeted
                    varied greatly, there were many interesting notes that came up. One of which that caught our
                    attention across the three art forms was the need to map the creative process and keep track of
                    ideas that spur when you least expect it.

                <h4>Storyboards</h4>
                <p>To get a better sense of how we could target this need, we began to storyboard what a potential
                    user’s creative process might look like. This would give more insight on their behaviors and actions
                    when a problem might occur.

                <p>One insight we found really changed how we wanted to target the user’s needs. Many people struggled
                    with a loss of motivation out of frustration in their work or a lack of ideas. While there were
                    moments in their day where they had many ideas and couldn’t sit down to create them, there were
                    other moments where they did have the time but their mood affected their work. Not only did we want
                    our app to help organize the creative process, we wanted to insure that our user would stay inspired
                    and motivated as they created as that had a big impact on what they made.

                <h4>Paper Prototypes</h4>
                <p>With our storyboards, interviews, and observations to guide us, the next step was creating paper
                    prototypes of how the user’s interaction with our app might occur. The creative art process is very
                    abstract so how we framed our app would have to fit that unique experience while having a uniform
                    design for multiple users. Below is an example of a prototype I made.

                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                <p>While ideating many different possible pages our app could have, we came up with several main pages
                    and functions. We then created wireframes of the main features of our app to guide us in our
                    functional prototype.

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>With our prototypes, we then began to do user testing to see if the functions we added were needed in
                    the first place and if the task flows were intuitive. What we found was the appeal of the sprout
                    page and that some functions were more intuitive than others. These notes helped us understand which
                    functions we had to scaffold for the user and how to improve the user’s interactions with the app.
                    Below are some examples of the changes we made.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>One change we made was the navbar. We found that it was better to declutter the navbar by turning the
                    "Plant Project" function into a popup rather than add it via the navbar. We also moved the function
                    next to the home button so people would not mistakenly logout.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Another change was scaffolding the "Sprout leaf" function for new users. We found that most users
                    tended to click on the instruction box rather than the button on the navbar. With this information,
                    we decided to turn the description into the button itself. This also encourages people to continue
                    to grow the treeline as the function as now a part of it like a growing tree.

                <h4>Comparative Evaluations</h4>
                <p>To ensure that our redesign of the "Sprout Leaf" function was indeed needed, we tested the two
                    versions to see which would be more intuitive for the users. With A/B testing, we found that the
                    redesign decreases the time it take for the new user to click on the function, which was our goal.

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>With the topic that my team tackled, it allowed me to explore how the interfaces we use can also
                    contribute the the mood and feelings that we experience while using them. This was especially
                    important with the problem we were providing a solution for as many artists struggled with
                    frustration that hindered their creativity. As the main UX designer, I was learned through many
                    iterations how changing even a single word or location of a function could drastically change how a
                    person. An example of this was the wording I used for a lot of the functions on the app. Instead of
                    timeline, add, or file, words like treeline, sprout, or leaves encouraged the people to interact
                    with the app more and increased their enjoyment with their projects as well. No matter how small the
                    interactions the user might have with your app, you have the chance to make them all count. This
                    project also showed me the importance to not assume what the user will do. A lot of the initial
                    locations of the functions was placed due to our assumption on how users would use the app. Once we
                    began to user test, we found that it was better to design our app to follow their path rather than
                    reformatting our app to make them follow ours. There is a lot of insights you can get from user
                    testing and observations if you are open to listen to them.
