            <h3>Observations & Interviews</h3>
            <p>In order to better understand the creative process and what can lead to an art block, I began
                observing and interviewing people involved in different art forms. While dance and drawing are two
                very different mediums, we were able to find connections when simplifying their creative processes
                to the basics. While an individual’s work can come from their imagination, a lot of their creativity
                can be inspired by the physical world and their work can drastically change over time.

    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>Observations allowed me to see how often the participants would reference physical objects and use
                tools to continue their work. It was when they ran out of ideas AND had no more references for
                inspiration that they felt demotivated. Creators needed a way to keep track of their process and
                references
                that inspired them in order to keep that motivation going.

            <h3>Storyboards</h3>
            <p>To get a better sense of how we could target this need, we began storyboarding what a potential
                user’s creative process might look like if given a solution. This would give more insight on their
                behaviors and actions when a problem might occur.

                there were other moments where they did have the time but no urge to create. We needed
                to fill that gap between moments of inspiration and the creation of art.

            <h3>Lo-fi to Hi-fi Prototyping</h3>
            <p>With our storyboards, interviews, and observations to guide us, the next step was creating paper
                prototypes for the user interface. The creative art process is different for everyone, so how we framed
                our app would have to fit that unique experience while having a uniform design for multiple users.

        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>With our prototypes, we then began to do user testing to see if the functions we added were needed in
                the first place and if the task flows were intuitive. What we found was the appeal of the sprout
                page and that some functions were more intuitive than others. These notes helped us understand which
                functions we had to scaffold for the user and how to improve the user’s interactions with the app.
                Below are some examples of the changes we made.

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>One change we made was the navbar. We found that it was better to declutter the navbar by turning the
                "Plant Project" function into a popup rather than add it via the navbar. We also moved the function
                next to the home button so people would not mistakenly logout.

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>Another change was scaffolding the "Sprout leaf" function for new users. We found that most users
                tended to click on the instruction box rather than the button on the navbar. With this information,
                we decided to turn the description into the button itself. This also encourages people to continue
                to grow the treeline as the function as now a part of it like a growing tree.

        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <h3>Comparative Evaluations</h3>
            <p>To ensure that our redesign of the "Sprout Leaf" function was indeed needed, we tested the two
                versions to see which would be more intuitive for the users. With A/B testing, we found that the
                redesign decreases the time it take for the new user to click on the function, which was our goal.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>With the topic that my team tackled, it allowed me to explore how the interfaces we use can also
                contribute the the mood and feelings that we experience while using them. This was especially
                important with the problem we were providing a solution for as many artists struggled with
                frustration that hindered their creativity. As the main UX designer, I was learned through many
                iterations how changing even a single word or location of a function could drastically change how a
                person. An example of this was the wording I used for a lot of the functions on the app. Instead of
                timeline, add, or file, words like treeline, sprout, or leaves encouraged the people to interact
                with the app more and increased their enjoyment with their projects as well. No matter how small the
                interactions the user might have with your app, you have the chance to make them all count. This
                project also showed me the importance to not assume what the user will do. A lot of the initial
                locations of the functions was placed due to our assumption on how users would use the app. Once we
                began to user test, we found that it was better to design our app to follow their path rather than
                reformatting our app to make them follow ours. There is a lot of insights you can get from user
                testing and observations if you are open to listen to them.
