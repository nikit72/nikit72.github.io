                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">Formed 10 years ago, the LAB was created to serve and unify the
                    dance community at University of California, San Diego. While that has stayed as their mission over
                    the years, present day has found the LAB in a precarious situation. While dancers use the LAB’s main
                    communication tool, a Facebook Group, and go to their annual events, the LAB’s lack of organization
                    and brand identity has led to low recruitment rates and a dwindling presence among dancers. My team
                    was assigned to create a site that would counter these issues.

                    users, we first began by interviewing the LAB staff and people who were interested in dance or
                    already dancers. We discovered there were many different priorities among our interviewees, which
                    allowed us to categorize our main users into these groups: LAB staff, exploring dancer, and dance
                    team leadership.</p>

                <p>Using what we learned from the interviews and personas that dove deeper into the different journeys
                    of our users, we then developed key use cases and used card

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>With a sense of how the information architecture of the site should look, we began ideating the
                    structure of the site. As the mobile version would be the most simplified version of the site, we
                    began with sketches of the mobile site. We did a few iterations based on the feedback we received,
                    such as the iteration below.</p>
                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded animated fadeIn delay-0.95s"

                </div>
                <p>While people initially expressed interest in a “resources” page, I found that users searched for that
                    information elsewhere. I decided it was more beneficial to create a “get involved” page based on the
                    LAB’s needs, as it primed users for participation before encouraging them to sign up for the LAB.
                    Below is the information architecture we settled on.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-12">

                <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
                <p>Once we had a solid wireframe down, the next step was exploring the LAB’s branding. Based on current
                    dance trends and the LAB’s loose theme, we created multiple moodboards to
                    help visualize a new brand identity. Below are moodboards I created, with the first one being chosen
                    for
                    the LAB’s official brand identity.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded animated fadeIn delay-0.95s"
                            src="images/labmood1.png" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Discussing the options with our client, we decided dramatic, sleek, dynamic, and science would best
                    represent who they are. This would allow us to highlight dance visuals, creating a sense of awe and
                    emphasizing the most important parts of dance: movement and the people. These beautiful visuals
                    would then pop through bold juxtaposition with dark purple backgrounds. We also wanted to create the
                    distinction that this dance community is at UCSD, a major STEM university, via the science theme.

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Once in the prototyping phase, users began giving us more in depth feedback on the content on the
                    site. One of the hurdles we experienced was the text on the site. Due to the name of the
                    organization, a majority of our user testers were confused as to what the Lab was. Through multiple
                    iterations of the homepage, we were able to create a statement that encompasses much of what the Lab
                    represented in a few words.

                </div>
                <p>As we prototyped the mobile site, we began prototyping out the desktop site as well. This allowed us
                    to explore different dimensions and functions only possible on a desktop.

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The Lab was very satisfied with our final design. The site would be able to help guide new and
                    current dancers in finding where they belong in the dance community, level the playing field for
                    dance teams in exposure, help dance teams communicate with each other, and increase publicity of the
                    Lab. Through our branding, people can see that there are not only dance teams at UCSD, but a
                    thriving dance community. Feel free to explore our <u><a

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>As someone who has led a dance team at UCSD myself, this project allowed me to take a step back from
                    my experiences, see the journeys others have taken, and see how much potential the UCSD dance
                    community has. Through the multiple iterations that we went through, I learned the importance of
                    really knowing the industry you are working with in order to tap into that potential. While we could
                    design a site that might look outwardly beautiful, if we do not create a site that will serve the
                    needs of our users, our site will not have truly fulfilled its purpose. While we all had many great
                    ideas for the site, honing in on what would best fit our audience was sometimes very difficult when
                    we had to account for multiple user perspectives. Going through that process shows you all the
                    possibilities rather than failures that you can have until you land on one that fits while
                    accounting for previous scenarios you might not have thought about before. My team especially was
                    great to work with when it came to this. Sharing ideas with each other, being open to new ideas,
                    voicing our opinions and critiques, this was essential in getting us to our final design.
