                    dance teams are popping up and
                    creating a legacy of their own. With over a thousand dancers at UCSD, the Lab was formed over 10
                    years ago to unite this growing dance community. Their mission is to create a hub where people can
                    find where they belong in the dance community, explore what the community has to offer, and share
                    what they have learned. While they contribute to annual events and performances to highlight the
                    UCSD dance teams and create an environment of support among dancers, their exposure as an official
                    organization has slowly dwindled. Many attend their events and use their resources, but not many
                    know who hosts them and that for these events to exist and for the Lab to survive, they need student
                    leaders to join the Lab.</p>

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">We first began to gather information about the Lab and their work
                    so far while researching the dance
                    community here at UCSD. With the information from our client interview, we defined our users into
                    three possible categories: exploring dancers, dance team leadership, and dance legacies. This
                    allowed us to account for new and current dancers, leadership, and dancers who have graduated but
                    continue to dance at UCSD. We conducted user observations and interviews with dancers of various
                    experiences and backgrounds. While we had initially believed that dance legacies would be a possible
                    user, we found through interviews
                    that they did not have many issues learning about the dance community because of their long history
                    in the community and other priorities. This allowed us to
                    prioritize exploring dancers and dance team leadership. We then created personas and scenarios they
                    would run into if they tried to learn more about the dance community at UCSD.</p>

                    solutions to the problems they experienced. While some people had what looked
                    like the same problems, their experiences diversified how they would find a solution and gave us
                    insight on how we could scaffold those moments.</p>

                <h4>Competitive Analysis & Branding</h4>
                <p>While the Lab has existed for over 10 years, their prioritizing of the dance community meant that
                    they had not focused on branding their organization. This meant that each year, their logos and
                    designs would change and there was no consistency. This gave us both a lot of creative freedom and
                    little direction to go with. Through competitive analysis of other sites that served similar
                    functionality and research into the current dance community and trends, we gained key information on
                    site architecture and functionality that would help dancers find what they need on our site. Below
                    is the site architecture of the main pages of our site. We wanted to keep it simple to understand
                    for new dancers and be action oriented when encouraging people to join the Lab. </p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-1">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-10">

                </div>
                <p> With the current dance trends and themes we researched, we also created multiple moodboards to help
                    with the branding of the Lab. Discussing the options with our client, we decided on the Lab brand:
                    dramatic,
                    sleek, dynamic, and science theme. This would allow us to focus on visuals of the dance community
                    through the bold juxtaposition with the dark purple backgrounds. This focus on movement and the
                    people themselves creates a welcoming vibe and highlights the most important part of dance:
                    movement. We also wanted to create the distinction that this dance community is at UCSD, a major
                    STEM college,
                    via the science theme. Below are examples of moodboards I created.

                <h4>Prototyping & Testing</h4>
                <p>We went through multiple iterations of the wireframe and prototypes with feedback from different
                    levels of dancers at each step. This was really important when it came to new dancers who weren't
                    sure of what certain dance terms meant or what the Lab actually was. </p>

                <p>While we had a big focus on how
                    users could discover dance teams and events at UCSD, we also wanted to be just as impactful in
                    encouraging people to learn
                    more about the Lab. This indirect method changed how we structured the site as we would leave trails
                    for people to follow and ensure our wording were direct calls to action depending on which page they
                    decided to navigate.
                    Due to the amount of information that needed to be on this site, we had to implement methods of
                    UX writing that would immediately pull people to important information on each page. Below are
                    examples of the tweaks we made to highlight certain information and make it look more appealing to
                    those on the site.

                    One of the hurdles we did not expect was the homepage itself. Due to the name of the
                    organization, a majority of our user testers were confused as to what the Lab was. Their slogan
                    “Like a chem lab, but for dance.” was not as straightforward at describing what the
                    organization was, especially for new dancer. Through multiple iterations and redesigning of the
                    homepage, we were able to create a
                    statement that encompass much of what the Lab represented in a few words. We also included an event
                    scrollable timeline on the homepage in order to actively engage people to explore events after
                    calling them to dance with us.

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>The Lab was very satisfied with our final design. The site would be able to help guide new and
                    current dancers in finding where they belong in the dance community, level the playing field for
                    dance teams in exposure, help dance teams communicate with each other, and increase publicity of the
                    Lab. Through our branding, people can see that there are not only dance teams at UCSD, but a
                    thriving dance community. Feel free to explore our <u><a

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>As someone who has led a dance team at UCSD myself, this was a great opportunity to give back to a
                    community I am very passionate about. This project allowed me to take a step back from my
                    experiences, see the journeys others have taken, and see how much potential the UCSD dance community
                    has. Through the multiple iterations that we went through, I learned the importance of really
                    knowing the industry you are working with in order to tap into that potential. While we could design
                    a site that might look outwardly beautiful, if we do not create a site that will serve the needs of
                    our users, our site will not have truly fulfilled its purpose. While we all had many great ideas for
                    the site, honing in on what would best fit our audience was sometimes very difficult when we had to
                    account for multiple user perspectives. It taught me the importance of continuously reiterating and
                    to not be afraid of those changes. You might find that you go in circles or your previous idea was
                    better, but designing is not a linear path. Going through that process shows you all the
                    possibilities rather than failures that you can have until you land on one that fits while
                    accounting for previous scenarios you might not have thought about before. My team especially was
                    great to work with when it came to this. Sharing ideas with each other, being open to new ideas,
                    voicing our opinions and critiques, this was essential in getting us to our final design.
