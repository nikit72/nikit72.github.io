                    Established 10 years ago, the LAB was created to serve and unify the dance community at University
                    of California, San Diego. While that has stayed as their mission over the years, present day has
                    found the LAB in a precarious situation as the community they serve has grown from the 100's to
                    1000’s.

                <p>The LAB hosts multiple annual events to highlight dance teams, and dedicates themselves to bringing
                    dancers together. While dancers perform at their events and use their main communication tool, a
                    Facebook group, to share information and stay up to date, the lack of brand identity and the
                    constraints in information organization has led to a disconnected community and a lack of
                    recognition of the LAB among dancers.

                <p class="animated fadeIn delay-0.10s">To better understand the issues dancers faced and the
                    solutions the LAB already had, we gathered responses via surveys and conducted 9 in-depth interviews
                    of the LAB staff members and both prospective and experienced dancers. We wanted to know how
                    dancers currently found information about dance, what problems they were facing, and how aware they
                    were of the LAB. Communication and organization was found to be a big issue as the LAB was not able
                    to scale
                    with the dance community over time.</p>

                        discovered from our interviews, we categorized our audience into 3 user types: LAB staff,
                        exploring dancer, and dance team leadership. Via personas, we immersed ourselves in the
                        emotional nuances people experienced as they faced their problems. While we knew people didn't
                        know where to look for dance information, personas allowed us to really think about the anxiety
                        a novice dancer might feel when going to their first event or the insecurities a dancer might be
                        hiding as they pursue a new team.</p>

                        in which a website would indeed solve people’s problems and used card sorting to visualize our
                        users’ mental model of how information would be grouped. While the LAB did request a website,
                        our research was able to back the decision that a site would be a scalable solution to the LAB’s
                        issues and the growing problems of the dancers. People needed a novice friendly resource that
                        consolidated information about the dance community, and this resource would inform them of the
                        people who were doing this work as well.</p>

                    <p>With a sense of how the information architecture of the site should look, we began ideating
                        the
                        structure of the site. As the mobile version would be the most simplified version of the
                        site, we
                        began with sketches of the mobile site. We did a few iterations based on the feedback we
                        received,
                        such as the iteration below.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>While people initially expressed interest in a “resources” page, I found that users searched
                        for that
                        information elsewhere. I decided it was more beneficial to create a “get involved” page
                        based on the
                        LAB’s needs, as it primed users for participation before encouraging them to sign up for the
                        LAB.
                        Below is the information architecture we settled on.</p>

                    <p>Once we had a solid wireframe down, the next step was exploring the LAB’s branding. Based on
                        current
                        dance trends and the LAB’s loose theme, we created multiple moodboards to
                        help visualize a new brand identity. Below are moodboards I created, with the first one
                        being chosen

                        the LAB’s official brand identity.</p>

                        would best
                        represent who they are. This would allow us to highlight dance visuals, creating a sense of
                        awe and
                        emphasizing the most important parts of dance: movement and the people. These beautiful
                        visuals
                        would then pop through bold juxtaposition with dark purple backgrounds. We also wanted to
                        create the
                        distinction that this dance community is at UCSD, a major STEM university, via the science
                        theme.

                    <p>Once in the prototyping phase, users began giving us more in depth feedback on the content on
                        the
                        site. One of the hurdles we experienced was the text on the site. Due to the name of the
                        organization, a majority of our user testers were confused as to what the Lab was. Through
                        multiple
                        iterations of the homepage, we were able to create a statement that encompasses much of what
                        the Lab
                        represented in a few words.

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>The Lab was very satisfied with our final design. The site would be able to help guide new
                        and
                        current dancers in finding where they belong in the dance community, level the playing field
                        for
                        dance teams in exposure, help dance teams communicate with each other, and increase
                        publicity of the
                        Lab. Through our branding, people can see that there are not only dance teams at UCSD, but a
                        thriving dance community. Feel free to explore our <u><a
